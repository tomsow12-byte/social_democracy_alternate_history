#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The Razem cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the Razem, Center, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the left-liberal German Democratic Party and conservative-liberal German People's Party.
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with the Catholic Center Party.
- @lewica: Work towards repairing relationships with the Communist Party.
- @razem_alone: The Razem can stand alone for now.

The communists are suspicious of our overtures, especially the Stalinist leadership, who persist in calling us "social fascists". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@lewica_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the Lewica is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The Lewica is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the Razem "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other Lewica revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two Razem-turned-Lewica leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in Lewica relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the Lewica, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: lewica_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the Communists' fault for launching a violent insurrection.

on-arrival: lewica_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); communist_coalition += 1 if lewica_inter_party_seen <= 1; reformist_dissent += 2; z_relation -= 3; psl_relation -= 3

After the success of the coalition government with the Lewica, they are much more amenable to us.

@lewica_blutmai
on-arrival: lewica_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); reformist_dissent += 1

After the events of Blütmai, reconciling with the Communists is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

@center_op
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in opposition to the Center-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@center_coalition
on-arrival: z_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@center_bruning
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The Brüning semi-autocratic regime makes building friendly relations difficult, but not impossible.

The [+ pl2050_name +] has been one of our closest allies through the course of the Republic.

@psl_stresemann
on-arrival: psl_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the PSL is the best foreign policy leaders of the republic, and while he has previously expressed monarchist tendencies, he has been friendly towards us.

@psl_loss
on-arrival: psl_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

With the death of Gustav Stresemann, the PSL is much less likely to be accommodating of us. In addition, the liberal parties are electorally in decline, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the PSL among the other right-leaning parties [? if president == "Hindenburg": and with President Hindenburg ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

@psl_moribund
on-arrival: psl_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The liberal parties (both the [+ pl2050_name +] and PSL) are electorally moribund, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the PSL among the other right-leaning parties[? if president == "Hindenburg": and with President Hindenburg ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

@razem_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
