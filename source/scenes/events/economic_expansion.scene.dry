= Economic Expansion

The German economy has been growing steadily for an extended period of time, and has low inflation and unemployment. The government is rewarded by additional tax revenue from the same tax rates. Even the capitalists find that they have little to complain about when it comes to government policies. One downside of this economic growth, however, is the rising risk of inflation.
